> ## Challenge B: Most Frequent Number

### - I created a function called mostfrequentnumber that takes an array arr as input. First, it checks if the array is empty and exits if so. Then, it uses an object numCount to count how many times each number appears.

### After counting, it sets a variable maxCount to 1 and loops through the counts to find the number with the highest frequency.

### If all numbers are unique (no repeats), it prints "All the numbers are unique" and returns the first number in the array. Otherwise, it returns the number that appears the most.
